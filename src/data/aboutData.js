    "Y≈çkoso!(welcome!) I'm Lewis. In the day I'm a full stack web developer for IBM and government organisations. In the evenings I volunteer with IBM to tutor people from disadvantaged backgrounds to learn fundamental web dev skills. I also try to create cool applications to help people, playing video games, at the gym, or probably lost. I am passionate about learning and working collaboratively with others to create useful tools",

    'I grew up in Coventry, had cross country national trials in high school, graduated with a BSc in Biochem & Neuroscience. I then wanted to fulfill a dream to live in Japan and broaden my skills and left for greener pastures to Osaka, Japan in 2015, where I immersed in the culture & language for two years and developed an addiction to (authentic) sushi. I returned to the UK and joined a Japanese international manufacturing company involved in Semiconductors where I travelled all over the EU regularly. Here I picked up essential German phrases like "Ein Weissbier, bitte" (One wheat beer, please) ',

    'After my experience of the archaic Japanese web design and the opportunity to give my creative ideas, this spurred me on to change career and to have a more flexible work-life balance and in late 2019 I enrolled in MSc Computer Sci at Uni of Birmingham. At the time I had no experience with programming but I had a clear vision of an app I wanted to create. After stumbling many times on my journey I managed to create the application I envisaged. I would like to enable and share my knowledge to those who are creative or are thinking about a career in software',
