    "Y≈çkoso!(welcome!) I'm Lewis. In the day I'm a full stack web developer for IBM, probably with 100s of Stack Overflow tabs. In the evenings I am either making cool applications to help people, playing DOTA 2, at the gym, or lost. I am passionate about side projects and working collaboratively with others to create useful tools",

    'I grew up in Coventry, had cross country national trials in high school, graduated with a BSc in Biochem & Neuroscience. I then wanted to fulfill a dream to live in Japan and broaden my skills and left for greener pastures to Osaka, Japan in 2015, where I immersed in the culture & language for two years and developed an addiction to (authentic) sushi. I returned to the UK and joined a Japanese international manufacturing company involved in Semiconductors where I travelled all over the EU regularly. Here I picked up essential German phrases like "Ein Weissbier, bitte" ',

At the time I had no experience with programming but I had a clear vision of an app I wanted to create. After failing many times on my journey I managed to create the application I envisaged (see honyomi below). I would like to enable and share my knowledge to those who are creative or are thinking about a career in software',
